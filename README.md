# 🎓 EduAI Tutor – AI-Powered Educational Platform

## 🧭 Project Objective

EduAI Tutor is an AI-powered educational web platform with multi-agent intelligence.  
It allows any learner to efficiently train in development (Python, FastAPI, etc.) through:

- **dynamically generated courses**,
- **interactive quizzes** (solo or group),
- **intelligent search** (educational chatbot),
- **personalized revision** based on mistakes.

Everything is developed with **Django** and integrates generative AI components via **LangChain + Mistral**.

## 🧠 AI Architecture – Specialized Multi-agents

| AI Agent        | Role                      | Main Function                                               |
|------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧠 Researcher      | Retriever                 | Retrieves relevant educational resources                    |
| 📖 Pedagogue      | Synthesizer              | Generates structured course from found resources            |
| 🎯 AI Coach       | Exercise Generator       | Creates MCQs, completions, bugs to fix                     |
| 📊 Watcher (*)| Analysis & tracking       | Observes performance, detects errors, triggers revision    |

(*) optional in first MVP

## 🧩 Features – Logical Journey

### 1. 📖 On-demand course generation

- User chooses a theme (e.g.: Python decorators)
- AI generates a complete course: introduction, explanation, examples, summary
- Agents involved: **Researcher + Pedagogue**

### 2. 🔍 Intelligent search (chatbot)

- User freely asks questions (e.g.: "Difference POST/PUT?")
- AI uses **RAG** engine to search and synthesize the answer
- Agents involved: **Researcher + Pedagogue**

### 3. 📝 Quiz & MCQ (solo or multiplayer)

- MCQs dynamically generated from course or theme
- **Solo** mode for individual training
- **Multiplayer** mode (Kahoot-style!) with live leaderboard
- Agent involved: **AI Coach**

### 4. 📊 Performance tracking

- Progress dashboard
- Error analysis, response time, overall score
- Agent involved: **Watcher**

### 5. 🔁 Personalized intelligent revision

- Revision card generation (Anki-style)
- Targeted mini-quizzes to fill detected gaps
- Agents involved: **Watcher + AI Coach**
